### Known Outstanding issues ###
* **Firefox:**     Versions 17-22 display the default toolbar icons in place of the Persona Switcher icon for the toolbar button.
* **Firefox:**     Versions 23-28 do not load the toolbar button.
* **Thunderbird:** Currently does not work with Thunderbird. Addon will install and run seemlessly, but upon restart of Thunderbird it crashes. If subsequently disabled then enabled again, it will resume working.
* **Warning:**     "No chrome package registered for chrome://personaswitcher/skin/PersonaSwitcher32.png" still haven't found what is causing this warning.

### Future Scheduled Updates ###
* **Testing:**  Finish converting the automated testing and test run to the new bootstrap architecture.
* **Lint:**     Finish integrating ESLint or JSHint
* **APP Version Testing:** Finish testing the addon in older version of the non Firefox applications as well, in order to determine the correct min version for each.
